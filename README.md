# clickup-client

A browser/Node.js client for interacting with ClickUp's v2 API. Authored in TypeScript and
exports ESM modules.

## Notes

- For now, this only supports instances where you can provide a Personal Access Token. I
  am very much building this for my own needs at the moment but if this library becomes
  useful for others I may go for a more featured approach.
